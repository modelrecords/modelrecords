Model Details:
  - Name: Inflection-1
  - Version: 1
  - Release Date: June 22, 2023
  - Developed By: Inflection AI
  - Model Type: Large Language Model (LLM) based on the Transformer architecture

Intended Use:
  - To create personal AIs for everyone with capabilities in language generation and understanding
  - To serve as the foundation model powering Pi, an LLM-based personal AI designed to be empathetic, useful, and safe

Factors:
  - Factor 1: Language comprehension and reasoning skills
  - Factor 2: Knowledge across a wide range of domains and tasks

Metrics:
  - Metric 1: Performance across a variety of benchmarks including commonsense tasks, question answering, knowledge-intensive tasks, reading comprehension, and code generation
  - Metric 2: 0-shot and 1-shot evaluation results, comparing performance without instruction tuning or RLHF

Evaluation Data:
  - Description: A diverse collection of benchmarks including Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU), TriviaQA, Natural Questions, and commonsense benchmarks like PIQA and HellaSwag

Training Data:
  - Description: Inflection-1 was trained on a large dataset using thousands of NVIDIA H100 GPUs. The specifics of the architecture, dataset, and training procedure are proprietary

Ethical Considerations:
  - The foundation LLM undergoes a complex adaptation process, including alignment with human preferences and a safety policy, before deployment in user-facing products
  - A variant of Inflection-1 that incorporates a safety policy is deployed in the personal AI product Pi, indicating that some capabilities are enhanced while others are suppressed due to safety considerations

Caveats and Recommendations:
  - Caveat/Recommendation 1: Code generation is the only benchmark where Inflection-1 underperforms compared to GPT-3.5, suggesting limitations in its coding capabilities
  - Caveat/Recommendation 2: Further advancements in AI capabilities and safety are needed to usher in new products and user experiences, underlining the importance of continuous improvement of AI models

Additional Information:
  - Additional Information 1: Inflection-1 outperforms well-known models such as GPT-3.5, LLaMA, PaLM 540B, and Chinchilla on a large number of benchmarks, being the best performing model in its compute class
  - Additional Information 2: Pi (pi.ai) was released by Inflection AI in May 2023 as an empathetic, useful, and safe personal AI powered by the foundation model, Inflection-1
