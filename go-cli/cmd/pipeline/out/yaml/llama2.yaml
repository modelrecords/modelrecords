Additional Information:
- Custom commercial license available for download.
- Responsible Use Guide and model [README](README.md) provided for guidelines on providing
  feedback or comments.
Caveats and Recommendations:
- Developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications
  of the model.
- Use outside of English requires developer fine-tuning in compliance with the Llama
  2 Community License and Acceptable Use Policy.
Ethical Considerations:
- The model may produce inaccurate, biased, or other objectionable responses to user
  prompts.
- Testing has been primarily in English and may not cover all possible scenarios or
  languages.
Evaluation Data:
  Description: Uses a mix of standard academic benchmarks and safety-specific datasets
    like TruthfulQA and ToxiGen to evaluate model performance.
Factors:
- Custom training libraries
- Meta's Research Super Cluster and production clusters for pretraining
- Third-party cloud compute for fine-tuning, annotation, and evaluation
Intended Use:
- Commercial and research use in English
- Assistant-like chat for tuned models
- Adaptable for a variety of natural language generation tasks for pretrained models
Metrics:
- Internal evaluation library results for academic benchmarks
- Human evaluations for helpfulness and safety
